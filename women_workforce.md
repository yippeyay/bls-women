Leisure & Hospitality has the highest job growth for women, May 2021

Data source: BLS https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t21.htm

Visual:  https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6527466/

I wanted to know which industries are growing for female employees as the economy recovers from Covid. I looked at raw numbers of female employees per industry as well as the gender ratio in them. However, there were no stark outliers in the analysis of job growth. Job growth was either flat or marginal across the industries, so this made the lines in the visualization not very interesting. The raw number of jobs made the bar charts also hard to see any increases. I eventually settled on this table -- due to my limitations on Pandas. 

I don't like that the mini line charts all look the same and that I couldn't make it show the difference between 1% and 45% visually. 

1. cleaned data from the website in Google Sheets (with help from TA)
2. Did analysis using pandas, but am not caught up with my homework, so couldn't do much data analysis using Pandas
